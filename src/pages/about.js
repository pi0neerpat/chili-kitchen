            Hey all - welcome to the beginning of the Chili Token Community. We
            wanted to provide a quick explainer on what $CHILI is, what you can
            do with it, and most importantly how to claim it.
          </p>
          <h3>What is Chili?</h3>
          <p>
            $Chili is an experimental new community token aimed at aligning
            current and future cartel communities to kickstart collaboration. In
            plain English, it‚Äôs a new community that seeks to reward
            collaboration. Over the past years, we‚Äôve seen how effective
            cross-community collaboration was within the MetaCartel Ecosystem.
            Since then we‚Äôve been looking for ways to expand that community so
            we can bring more builders, creators, summoners, and community
            leaders together to collaborate.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>It‚Äôs the meta of the meta of the meta if you will.</b>
          </p>
          <h3>What to do with $CHILI ?</h3>
          <p>
            Great question! We‚Äôve built $CHILI to be an open platform and
            community driven effort that allows the coolest ideas to emerge and
            be built. Once you receive your $CHILI, the first step is to stake
            the $CHILI to earn rChili (aka Roasted Chili). Roasted Chili is what
            gives you access to buy exclusive NFTs, receive access to new
            Discord Channels/Communities, and receive perks from MetaCartel
            Ecosystem Projects. What we‚Äôre most excited for are the ideas we
            haven‚Äôt thought of yet. Before even launching, we‚Äôve had community
            members come forward with new ideas, usages, and partnerships we can
            make using the $CHILI token.{` `}
          </p>
          <h3>Claim and Stake it ?</h3>
          <p>
            We‚Äôre pretty excited about our claiming process using the
            Collab.Land Bot. All claiming will be done directly from the
            MetaCartel Discord Server in the ‚Äúüëâstart-here‚Äù channel. Once you
            join the channel: Use the !claim command. The Collab.Land bot will
            then DM you a link to use to both connect your address to your
            collab account as well allow you to claim your respective chili. No
            gas is required to receive your chili! After you claim your chili
            the bot will send you a link that will allow you to stake your
            chili. Note: To stake, you will need some Matic tokens to pay gas
            fees. Once you stake, sit back and enjoy a spicy margarita as you
            earn your rChili.
          </p>
          <h3>New CHILI Farms @ CHILIKITCHEN üî•</h3>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs time to get cooking! Now everything CHILI is hosted together on
            a fresh new site. We moved the existing ‚ÄúRoasted CHILI‚Äù farm here,
            and added a new Liquditiy Provider Farm! Eventually we‚Äôll have NFTs
            here, and much more. Have fun, and please be careful not to start
            any fires‚Ä¶ at least ones you can‚Äôt put out: https://chilikitchen.com
            are here for rCHILI-MATIC on Sushi! We‚Äôll be adding 1,736 rCHILI
            rewards per month for 3 months. Head over to the Chili Kitchen to
            get started. Also, you can read the forum discussion if you‚Äôre
            curious about reward calculations. Chili Roasting was a great
            success, with 190k CHILI staked and 525% APR rCHILI. The current
            monthly reward cycle ends Sunday, July 25, but the farm aint closing
            yet! 1,736 rCHILI rewards will be added on Monday, July 26. This
            will be the last cycle (for now), so make sure you get in while you
            can! CHILI Window Closing ! The claim window for $CHILI tokens has
            been open for 1 month. The remaining tokens will be transferred
            back.
          </p>

          <p>
            {` `}
            And that‚Äôs it! We‚Äôre pumped to see what comes from this new social
            community token experiment, and even more excited to see what you
            build.
          </p>
